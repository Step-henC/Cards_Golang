Intro to Golang with deck of cards


Took a Golang Tutorial one step further by adding a GUI using Fyne. 

This app can be launched with the cards.exe with a logo on Windows machines

This cards app is a table with a list of 52 cards in a deck that can be shuffled randomly and/or dealt.
Once the cards are dealt, they are saved into a file called "dealt_hand"
